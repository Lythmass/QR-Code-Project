## Overview

     A Simple challenge project by Frontend Mentor was done by Lythmass using basic HTML and CSS. This project contains simple QR code image and few more texts.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

Using Flexbox for this project was very easy, but in general it is very important and complex element in CSS in my opinion, so I am going to refine this skill as much as I can.
